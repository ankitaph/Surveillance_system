# Real-Time Stadium Surveillance Monitoring & Alert System  
AI-Based Person Tracking Using YOLOv8 + DeepSORT

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time **AI-driven stadium surveillance system** capable of detecting and tracking people using deep learning. The system uses **YOLOv8** for object detection and **DeepSORT** for multi-object tracking. It is designed to help stadium security teams monitor large crowds, identify potential threats, and improve situational awareness.

Although the dataset used for model training is **not included**, the project provides:

- A complete working **codebase**
- A pretrained **YOLOv8 model (.pt)** for person detection
- Full pipeline for **real-time tracking**
- Instructions for setup and usage

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect and track individuals in real-time.
- Enhance surveillance capabilities for stadium environments.
- Enable continuous monitoring through video feeds.
- Provide accurate person-counting and movement tracking.
- Lay the foundation for integrating threat detection (e.g., firearms) and drone-based monitoring.
